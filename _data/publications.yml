  summary: "We developed and characterized a thermostable antibody derived from lamprey variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that specifically detects Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2), a key biomarker for malaria diagnosis. This VLR antibody demonstrates exceptional stability at elevated temperatures, making it particularly valuable for diagnostic applications in resource-limited settings where cold chain storage is unavailable."

- title: "Proto-MHC signatures in the lamprey genome"
  authors: "Sutoh, Y., Ono, K., Minabe, S., <strong>Senanayake, S.</strong>, Ohmomo, H., Hachiya, T., Shimizu, A., & Hirano, M."
  venue: "bioRxiv (preprint)"
  year: 2025
  type: "preprint"

  summary: "This study presents evidence of proto-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) signatures in the lamprey genome, providing new insights into the evolutionary origins of adaptive immunity. Our findings reveal early molecular patterns that may have preceded the development of the sophisticated MHC system found in jawed vertebrates."
